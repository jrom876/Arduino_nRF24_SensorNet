# k30_nRF24
Transceiver pair for wireless environmental monitor written in C++ using Arduino, k30, nRF24, and DHT11.

This C++ code is for an Arduino wireless weather station using a transmitter/receiver pair in an observer pattern. 

The transmitter uses a k30 CO2 sensor from co2meter.com, an nRF24 transceiver, and a DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor. 

The receiver uses an nRF24 transceiver and a 20x4 LCD display.

This is an early stable version of my k30_nRF24 development code.
