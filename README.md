# k30_nRF24
Transceiver pair for 2.4GHz wireless sensor platform written in C++ using Arduino, k30, nRF24, and DHT11. 

The emacs version creates a wireless weather station using a server and a transmitter/receiver pair in an observer pattern. 

The emacs transmitter uses a k30 CO2 sensor from co2meter.com, an nRF24 transceiver, and a DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor. 

The emacs receiver uses an nRF24 transceiver and a 20x4 LCD display.

This repo is intended to hold stable versions of my k30_nRF24 development code.

Future versions will integrate other sensors sch as PIRs, SEN-12642 audio detector, and HH-6130 humid/temp sensor.
